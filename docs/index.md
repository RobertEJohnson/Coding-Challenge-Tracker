# Welcome Out!

**Challenge Documentation** is a weekly recap of all of the coding challenges I've undertaken each week. 

Select a week from the 'Weekly Recaps' navbar dropdown and you're good to go!
I'm tracking the following:

- Challenges I've tackled
- Awesome things I've learned
- Reflections on my process
- Adaptations/plans moving forward
